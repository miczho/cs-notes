# Mission Statement

You're here to learn about a specific development called Agile DevOps. Its a rigid process of making a product.

# Scrum

What is it? _Framework following the rules of agile devops_

Scrum can be divided into three main components, roles, events, & artifacts

__roles__ - what is each member responsible for
- product owner - communicates with stakeholders, manages Product Backlog and User Stories
- scrum master - enforces rules of Scrum, facilitates Daily Scrum, assists in maintaining Product Backlog and User Stories
- developer
- stakeholder

__events__ - important goals, items, milestones, etc. 
- backlog creation
- sprint planning
- daily scrum/daily standup - team meeting
    - "What have you worked on since last standup?""
    - "What are you working on now?"
    - "Is there anything blocking your work?"
- backlog grooming - refining the list of functionality
- sprint review
- stakeholder demo
- team retrospective

__artifacts__ - sources of development information
- sprint backlog - User Stories relevant to one specific sprint
- product backlog - User Stories relevant to entire product
- potentially reasonable product increment (not talked abt)

__sprints__ - working in a couple week period

__User Stories__ - Non-techinical sentence describing a product feature (As a \_\_\_, I want to \_\_\_, so that \_\_\_). Follows the INVEST acronym.  
__Planning Poker__ - technique for determining the Estimate of Effort of any User Story (Fibonacci Numbers)

__Spike__ - work that needs to be done that is not end-user-facing

__Cone of Uncertainty__ - uncertainty decreases as development increases.  
Agile's incremented structure minimizes the cone.

# Git & GitHub

Git is a version control system.

There are older version control systems, such as Subversion

- Git
    - Distributed
- Subversion & CVS
    - Centralized

# Web Architecture

I skipped class ðŸ¥´

<a id="04"></a>
# Javascript

Can run serverside (node.js) and clientside (browser).

Loosely typed variables
- var - function scoped, reassignable
- let - block scoped, reassignable
- const - block scoped, not reassignable

Protoypal inheritance (how tf this work?)

Functions can be instantiated in mainly 5 different ways

```javascript
// standard
function doSomething1() {
  console.log("doSomething1 is running")
}

// anonymous
const doSomething2 = function () {
  console.log("doSomething2 is running")
}

// arrow
const doSomething3 = () => {
  console.log("doSomething3 is running")
}

// immediately-invoked function expression (IIFE)
// Note that it is convention to place a semi-colon (;) before an immediately-invoked function in order to ensure it is interpreted as a separate statement from whatever comes above it in the code.
;(function doSomething5() {
  console.log("doSomething4 is running")
})

// new Function object
const doSomething5 = new Function("console.log('doSomething5 is running');");
```

### Objects

A lot of data structs are extensions of objects
