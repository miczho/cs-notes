## Binary Search Tree

For every node, the left subtree contains values less than the node, and the right subtree contains values greater than the node.

The search, insertion, and deletion of elements all take around O(log n) time.

This tree should be balanced to be efficient. \

The tree can be rotated to be balanced.
