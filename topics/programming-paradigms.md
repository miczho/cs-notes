OOP: Attributes vs Properties vs Parameters vs Arguments

Attributes and properties are basically the same thing

Attributes are data representing the state of an object.

Parameters are data passed into a method.

Arguments are the actual data being passed into a method.

When to use one or the other? Try to limit attributes to the necessities, since their scope reaches throughout the entire object. Conversely, a parameter's scope only exists in its associated method.
