*NODE.JS IS THE FOCUS, BUT ANY LANGUAGE IS ALLOWED*

# Mission Statement

You're here to learn about a specific development called Agile DevOps. Its a rigid process of making a product.

# Scrum

What is it? _Framework following the rules of agile devops_

Scrum can be divided into three main components, roles, events, & artifacts

__roles__ - what is each member responsible for
- product owner - communicates with stakeholders, manages Product Backlog and User Stories
- scrum master - enforces rules of Scrum, facilitates Daily Scrum, assists in maintaining Product Backlog and User Stories
- developer
- stakeholder

__events__ - important goals, items, milestones, etc. 
- backlog creation
- sprint planning
- daily scrum/daily standup - team meeting
    - "What have you worked on since last standup?""
    - "What are you working on now?"
    - "Is there anything blocking your work?"
- backlog grooming - refining the list of functionality
- sprint review
- stakeholder demo
- team retrospective

__artifacts__ - sources of development information
- sprint backlog - User Stories relevant to one specific sprint
- product backlog - User Stories relevant to entire product
- potentially reasonable product increment (not talked abt)

__sprints__ - working in a couple week period

__User Stories__ - Non-techinical sentence describing a product feature (As a \_\_\_, I want to \_\_\_, so that \_\_\_). Follows the INVEST acronym.  
__Planning Poker__ - technique for determining the Estimate of Effort of any User Story (Fibonacci Numbers)

__Spike__ - work that needs to be done that is not end-user-facing

__Cone of Uncertainty__ - uncertainty decreases as development increases.  
Agile's incremented structure minimizes the cone.
